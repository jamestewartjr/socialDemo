# SocialDemo

## What is this?
This is a social application created as the simple demostration of my ability and for learning. This application should not be used as production software, but feel free to fork and make it your own.

## Technologies
- React
- Firebase: Functions, Firestore, Authentication
- Express

## Interesting Bits
This application was interesting to me because it uses many of Google's Firebase services. In the past, I have had little interaction with implementation using Firebase, but not setup and implementation of authorization, data store, functions and triggers which was pretty interesting.

Particularly, I found that server side implementation of functions could reduce the size of this application significantly.
